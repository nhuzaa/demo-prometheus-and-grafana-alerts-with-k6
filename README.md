# Demo Alerting in Prometheus and Grafana 

Grafana Alerting is built on the Prometheus Alerting model. This demo project showcases the similarities between Prometheus and Grafana alerting systems, covering topics such as:

- Creating alerts in Prometheus
- Recreating the same alerts using Grafana
- Setting up alerts based on Loki logs
- Exploring alerting components like evaluation groups and notification policies
- Creating template notifications
- And more!

This project pairs well with this [Alerting Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XvJnBlNnXUjiS409ABN4NxNkFZoYDmoRKKoJqsvln-g/edit?usp=sharing). Together, they provide an excellent starting point for presenting the Prometheus Alerting model and demonstrating its use in Grafana.

## Run the demo environment

This repository includes a [Docker Compose setup](./docker-compose.yaml) that runs Grafana, Prometheus, Prometheus Alertmanager, Loki, and an SMTP server for testing email notifications.

To run the demo environment:

```bash
docker compose up
```

You can then access:
- Grafana: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- Prometheus web UI: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/)
- Alertmanager web UI: [http://localhost:9093](http://localhost:9093/)

### Generating test data

This demo uses [Grafana k6](https://grafana.com/docs/k6) to generate test data for Prometheus and Loki.

To run k6 tests and store logs in Loki and time series data in Prometheus, you'll need a k6 version with the `xk6-client-prometheus-remote` and `xk6-loki` extensions.

You can build the k6 version using the [`xk6` instructions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/extensions/build-k6-binary-using-go/) or Docker as follows:

<details>
  <summary>macOS</summary>

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it -e GOOS=darwin -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "${PWD}:/xk6" \
    grafana/xk6 build v0.55.0 \
    --with github.com/grafana/xk6-client-prometheus-remote@v0.3.2 \
    --with github.com/grafana/xk6-loki@v1.0.0
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Linux</summary>

  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "${PWD}:/xk6" \
    grafana/xk6 build v0.55.0 \
    --with github.com/grafana/xk6-client-prometheus-remote@v0.3.2 \
    --with github.com/grafana/xk6-loki@v1.0.0
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

  ```bash
docker run --rm -it -e GOOS=windows -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "${PWD}:/xk6" `
  grafana/xk6 build v0.55.0 --output k6.exe `
  --with github.com/grafana/xk6-client-prometheus-remote@v0.3.2 `
  --with github.com/grafana/xk6-loki@v1.0.0
```

</details>


Once you've built the necessary k6 version, you can pre-populate data by running the [scripts from the `testdata` folder](./testdata/) as follows:

```bash
./k6 run testdata/<FILE>.js
```

The `testdata` scripts inject Prometheus metric and Loki log data, which can be used to define alert queries and conditions. You can then modify and run the scripts to test the alerts.


### Receive webhook notifications

One of the simplest ways to receive alert notifications is by using a Webhook.  You can use [`webhook.site`](https://webhook.site/) to create Webhook URLs and view the incoming messages.

- For Prometheus alertmanager: 
  
  Set the Webhook URL to the [alertmanager.yml](./alertmanager/alertmanager.yml) configuration file.

- For Grafana:
  
  Create a Webhook contact point and assign it to the notification policy.

### Receive mail notifications

You can also configure notifications to be sent via your Gmail account using an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). After creating your App password:

- For Prometheus Alertmanager:

  Replace `your_mail@gmail` with your Gmail address in the [alertmanager.yml](./alertmanager/alertmanager.yml) configuration file.

  Copy `alertmanager/smtp_auth_password.example` to `alertmanager/smtp_auth_password` and set your password.

- For Grafana:

  Copy `environments/smpt.env.example` to `environments/smpt.env` and set the appropriate environment variables values.
